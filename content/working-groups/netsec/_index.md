## Background

In January 2013 the CA/Browser Forum’s “[**Network and Certificate System Security Requirements**](/working-groups/netsec/documents/)” (NCSSRs) became effective. In June 2017, the Forum chartered a Network Security Working Group to re-work the NCSSRs. That charter expired on June 19, 2018, and in October 2018, the Server Certificate Working Group (SCWG) established a Network Security Subcommittee (NetSec Subcommittee) to continue work on the NCSSRs. Since then, the Network Security Working Group (NetSec WG) has replaced the NetSec Subcommittee. The NetSec WG was created in December 2021 by [**Ballot Forum-17**](/2021/12/28/ballot-forum-17-creation-of-network-security-working-group/). Existing members of the CA/Browser Forum are eligible to participate in the NetSec WG.

## Scope of Work

The NetSec WG was chartered to continue work on the NCSSRs, and to conduct any and all business related to improving the security of Certification Authorities. The NetSec WG makes security-related recommendations to other Forum WGs for requirements or guidelines that are within their purview, i.e. the [Baseline Requirements](/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/about/)/[Extended Validation Guidelines](/working-groups/server/extended-validation/about/) of the [Server Certificate WG](/working-groups/scwg/), the [Baseline Requirements for Code Signing Certificates](/working-groups/code-signing/documents/) of the [Code Signing Certificate Working Group](/working-groups/code-signing/) or guidelines adopted by the [S/MIME Certificate Working Group](/working-groups/smime/).

The primary deliverable of the NetSec WG is the NCSSRs. Other work includes performing risk analyses, security analyses, and other types of reviews of threats and vulnerabilities applicable to CA operations involved in the issuance and maintenance of publicly trusted certificates (e.g. server certificates, code signing certificates, or SMIME certificates).
