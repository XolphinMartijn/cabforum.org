## Minutes

1.	Anti-trust reminder was read.
2.	Prior meeting minutes approved: August 22nd.
3.	Max validity of Code Signing certificates: Ian will send out the PR and the proposal on the period change by the end of this week.
4.	EV/OV consolidation: Ian will work with Bruce on a draft proposal. Topic will be discussed at the next Face to Face meeting.
5.	Fall elections: One person nominated for code signing chair, Martijn. Ratification ballot will be sent out next week after the discussion period ends.
6.	Other business: 
    a. Bruce noted that in the S/MIME working group, when the SSL Baseline Requirements (BR’s) are updated, they look at the ballot and determine if they should apply it to the S/MIME BR’s as well. This helps to keep things consistent, especially when a CA issues more than one type of certificate.
    b. Discussed of several ballots from other groups (S/MIME, TLS) that have either passed or are in draft status and whether or not we could do one clean up ballot or if we needed to have one ballot per item.
    c. Bruce will review the server group ballots and present a recommendation on whether or not we should include it, not include it or wait until the ballot passes.
7.	Other business: Face to Face Meeting 
    a. CWSWG scheduled for Thursday, 10/10, from 11 am – 1 pm.
    b. Plan is to go through the CS BR’s, to try to get alignment to align on the direction Microsoft wants to go in with the certificates.
8.	Meeting adjourned. Next meeting: September 19, 2024
