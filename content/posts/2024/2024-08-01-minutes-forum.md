## Read note-well

Dimitris read the note-well

## Review of Agenda

The agenda was approved with no changes.

## Approval of previous meetings

July 18 meeting minutes were approved.

## Server Certificate Working Group update

No update.

## Code Signing Certificate Working Group update

Dean gave the update:

- IPR for CSC25/26 ends today.
- Microsoft plans to propose a ballot that will change the validity of Code Signing Certificates to 15 months, effective April 30, 2025.
- Public and management lists are not functioning correctly and should probably migrate to Google Groups.

## S/MIME Certificate Working Group update

Stephen gave the update:

- Ballot SMC08 has passed and is currently in the IPR review period. This ballot deprecates the legacy profiles July 15, 2025.
- The TLS BRs introduce changes with the MPIC ballot.
- The WG is preparing how it will be adopted within the S/MIME BRs and whether it will support the same timing as in the TLS BRs.
- 14 CA operators are publicly trusted for S/MIME that do not issue TLS. They may not be as familiar with the MPIC discussions as other CAs that are also trusted for TLS.
- Accommodating changes for audit requirements for NetSec.
- After April 1, 2025, for WebTrust audits, there will be a separate WT audit for NetSec.

## NetSec Working Group update

Clint gave the update:

- Changes were proposed for sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.5 of the NCSSRs, dealing with workstations and passwords.
- The goal is to describe requirements that are more objective or principal-based rather than being too prescriptive.
- Ballot NSC004 is ready to go to the discussion period after finding endorsers.
- Trustcor's resignation was processed and confirmed for the NetSec WG.

## Definitions and Glossary Working Group

No update.

## Forum Infrastructure Subcommittee update

Ben gave the update:

- An email group was created for monitoring the servers (things like certificate validity, member's portal health, etc.).
- Ben, Jos, Martijn are on those lists. Ben asked if more people want to receive those emails, they can reach out to Ben and Jos.
- Dimitris also reminded that Slack could be used for alerts.

## Intellectual Property Rights Subcommittee

Ben gave the update:

- There is a straw-man proposal about how the Forum should treat invited experts.
- Seeking feedback on how the Forum should deal with Interested Parties.
- The approach is to have two agreements; one with an Organization, as an Interested Party, and the other with an Individual.
- The Forum wants to encourage participation from Interested Parties.
- The risk is that someone might sign as an individual without disclosing they are employed by a company, and then the company avoids IPR obligations.
- Anyone with ideas or feedback can share with the IPR subcommittee or join the subcommittee.
- The subcommittee has a deadline of October 1st to complete its work, or it should amend the charter to extend its lifetime.

## Elections 2024

Dimitris updated the group that nominations for the WG and Forum Chair positions are open. The end period is August 26, 2024. Nominations can be added directly to the wiki page or sent to the management list.

## Any Other Business

- **Fall F2F meeting:** Trev mentioned that Amazon has some internal procedures and cannot book places until two months in advance. She has a meeting scheduled to get the hotel information ready as soon as possible. Traveling information is expected to be updated on the wiki soon.
- **Summer 2025 F2F meeting:** Dimitris announced that the F2F meeting in Toronto, Canada, hosted by CPA Canada, has been confirmed to take place June 10-12, 2025.

## Next Call

The group agreed to cancel the August 15 Teleconference due to National Holidays in some European Countries. The next scheduled Teleconference is on August 29, 2025.

## Meeting Adjourned.
